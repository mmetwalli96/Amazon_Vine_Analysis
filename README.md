# Amazon Vine Analysis Report

## Project Overview
---

In this project, there are approximately 50 datasets. Each one contains reviews of a specific product, from clothing apparel to wireless products. One will be picked, and by using PySpark, the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin will be peroformed. Later, SQL will be used to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in the chosedn dataset.
